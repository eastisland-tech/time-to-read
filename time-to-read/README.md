Time To Read is a simple plugin that allows you to add a count to the top of your posts. This count informs the user how long, on average, it would take them to read the content of the post.

If you want to adjust the Words Per Minute setting, login into the admin dashboard, navigate to Settings -> Time To Read, and adjust the setting accordingly.

Thanks for checking out my code!
